Trained an XgBoost algorithm to "correctly predict whether the wormhole will successfully stabilize or collapse into failure".
XGBoost is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple weak models (usually decision trees) sequentially.
Each tree corrects the mistakes of the previous one by focusing more on the misclassified examples.
